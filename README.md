# Fictional-Music-Store-Sales-Data
Using SQL to Analyze a Fictional Music Store's Sales Data

This project uses SQLite to answer business questions.

In this project we'll be working with a modified version of a database called [Chinook](https://www.kaggle.com/samaxtech/chinook-music-store-data). The Chinook database contains information about a fictional digital music shop - kind of like a mini-iTunes store. The schema can be found in schema.png.
Check out the jupyter notebook Basics.ipynb for more details about the database and the queries along with their explanations.
